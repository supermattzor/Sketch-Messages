Sketch-Messages
===============

Yosemite Messages in Sketch

Made using Sketch and [Timur Carpeev's Generator plugin](https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin).

Known Issues
------------

*Some of this is me still not being entirely comfortable in Sketch and some is me putting off the experiementation time to figure some of it out.*

1. Missing compose icon
2. Current message title bar color is off
3. Gradient (and probably color) of blue messages is off
4. Window shadow is off
5. Right side of menu bar is empty
6. Hipsum sucks
7. The lack of "Read" on the last sent message when a reply exists doesn't make any sense.
